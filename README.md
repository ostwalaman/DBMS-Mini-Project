# DBMS-Mini-Project
Student Information Management System (SIMS)

Abstract:
	Implement MySQL / Oracle Database connectivity with PHP / Python / Java.
	Implement Database navigation operations (Add. Delete, Edit) using ODBC / JDBC.

Introduction:
	A Student Information Management System has been implemented using Python Programming along with MySQL Database Connectivity on Visual Studio Code (VSC).
	The purpose of this Mini-Project is to implement the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to database on a Real-Time example.
	Initially, MySQL was connected with Python using PyMySQL Library.
	A database was created with appropriate attributed for the same. The prime operations to be done are:
    1.	Inserting new Student Information in the table.
    2.	Displaying the Student Information.
    3.	Update Student Information.
    4.	Delete Student Information

Scope:
	This project provides a great help to teachers in managing the data of students in a well-mannered order. This project is designed specially to maintain Student Information like (ID, Name, Branch, Roll No., Gender).
